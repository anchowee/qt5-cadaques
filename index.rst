Qt5 Introduction
----------------

History:

    Qt4 has evolved since 2006 and provided a solid ground for thaousands of applications and even full desktop and mobile systems. The usage patterns computer users changed in the recent years. From stationary PCs towards portable desktop computer as this is and nowadays mobile computers. The classical desktop is more and more replaced with mobile touch-based always connected screens. With it the desktop UX paradigms also changes. Where as in the past Windows UI has dominated the world we spend more time nowadays on other screens with another UI language. 

    Another paragraph to go here.

    Qt4 was designed to satisfy the desktop world to have a coherent set of UI widgets available on all major platforms. The challenge for Qt users has changed today and it lies more to provide a touch-based user interface for a customer driven user interface and to enable modern user interface on all major desktop and mobile systems. Qt4.7 started to introduce the QtQuick technology which allows users to create a set of user interface components from simple elements to achieve a complete new UI, driven by customer demands.
